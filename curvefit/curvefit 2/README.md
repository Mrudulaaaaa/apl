# Running the code
- There's no specific way to run the program.
- I assumed that dataset1.txt, dataset2.txt, dataset3.txt are present in the directory and wrote the code
- Each code will display respective answers as asked in the questions on compiling
- Graphs have been attached in the documentation file. 
- On running the codes figures will be saved fpr each code, but the figures have all the plots in one figure.
